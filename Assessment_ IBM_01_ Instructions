Problem Statement
You are given access to an events database API that lists events happening in different countries.
The API endpoint is:
https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/events?country={country}&page={page}
•	country is the name of the country.
•	page is the page number of results (starting from 1).

The API returns a JSON response with the following fields:
•	page: current page number.
•	per_page: max results per page.
•	total: total number of results.
•	total_pages: number of pages in the query.
•	data: list of event objects.

Each event object contains:
•	name: the event name.
•	country: the country where it occurs.
•	date: the date of the event in ISO string format (e.g., "2024-05-11T13:20:42.1182").
•	(Other fields are not relevant here.)

Task
Write a function:
def futureEvents(country: str, plannedDate: int) -> [str]:

where:
country: the country where the event takes place.
plannedDate: a timestamp in Unix epoch milliseconds.

The function must:
•	Retrieve all events for the given country from the API.
•	Filter only the events that occur strictly after plannedDate.
•	Among these events:
o	Return the earliest event name (minimum date).
o	Return the latest event name (maximum date).
o	If no events are found, return ["", ""].

Input Format
•	The first line contains a string country.
•	The second line contains an integer plannedDate (Unix epoch milliseconds).

Output Format
•	Print the two event names, each on a new line.
•	If an event does not exist, print an empty string in its place.

Constraints
•	The API is only available inside Hackerrank’s environment.
•	Do not modify the given main method.

You must only implement the function futureEvents.
Provided Main Method
if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    country = input()
    plannedDate = int(input().strip())

    result = futureEvents(country, plannedDate)

    fptr.write('\n'.join(result))
    fptr.write('\n')

    fptr.close()
