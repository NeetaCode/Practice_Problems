# Two Sum.py:
#Given an array of integers and a target value, the task is to find the indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target. Each input is guaranteed to have exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice. The output should be the pair of indices, returned in any order.

# Palindrome Number.py:
#Check if an integer x reads the same forwards and backwards. Return true if it does, otherwise false. Negative numbers and numbers that change when reversed are not palindromes.
