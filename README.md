# Two Sum.py:
#Given an array of integers and a target value, the task is to find the indices of two numbers in the array that add up to the target. Each input is guaranteed to have exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice. The output should be the pair of indices, returned in any order.

# Palindrome Number.py:
#Check if an integer x reads the same forwards and backwards. Return true if it does, otherwise false. Negative numbers and numbers that change when reversed are not palindromes.

# Search Insert Position.py:
#The code defines a method searchInsert that uses binary search to find the index of a target in a sorted list nums. If the target exists, it returns its index. If not, it returns the index where the target should be inserted to maintain order.
#Uses left, right, and mid pointers to search efficiently.
#If not found, left gives the correct insertion position.

# Roman to Integer.py:
#Convert a Roman numeral string into an integer by mapping each symbol to its value. Add values unless a smaller numeral comes before a larger oneâ€”then subtract. Supports standard Roman numeral rules and works for values from 1 to 3999.

# Remove Element.py:
#Remove all occurrences of a given value val from the array nums in-place. Rearrange the array so the first k elements are the ones not equal to val, and return k. The order of elements can change, and anything beyond the first k elements doesn't matter.

# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array:
#Remove duplicates in a sorted integer array in-place so that each unique element appears only once. Return the number of unique elements, with the first part of the array holding these unique values in order.
